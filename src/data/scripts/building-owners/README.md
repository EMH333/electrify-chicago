# Building Owners Scripts

The benchmarking data doesn't who owns buildings clear, so we need to figure it out ourselves. This
directory of scripts can be manually run to find benchmarking buildings matching certain criteria
that indicate their ownership. **These scripts are not automatically run and integrated into our
data pipeline!**

These include:

- CHA (Chicago Housing Authority)
- CPS (Chicago Public Schools)
- Other City Buildings (e.g. City Hall, large libraries)

See each file for details.
