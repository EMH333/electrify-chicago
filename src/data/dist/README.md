# Data Dist Folder

This directory contains files used for the actual built site. These are committed, since the city
data (and our data pipeline) changes infrequently.

**Important!** To keep things clean, keep this directory minimal, and make sure all files are
auto-generated when you run the data pipeline - any manual custom information should live in our
JS files in Gridsome, not in the data pipeline.
