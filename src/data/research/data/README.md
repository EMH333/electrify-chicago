`Historical_GHG_Factors.xlsx`: These data are from [`Energy Star's Historical Greenhouse Gas Factors, 2000 â€“ present`](https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/tools-and-resources/historical-greenhouse-gas-factors-2000-present). When the `Subregion` is `NaN`, Energy Uses the national factor (i.e. no division by subregion for those energy sources).
